# Computational Quantum Physics - PR1
This repository is dedicated to the first project of the course Computational Quantum Physics of
my MSc Computational Physics in Aristotle University of Thessaloniki. This project focuses on
the computational calculation of Shannon Entropy 
and related measures for the first ten 
elements of periodic table (from He to Ne). It repository contains the report "report_entropy" , the datasets
"df" and "regress_data" ,the function that accompanies the main code and the main code under
the name "final_main".
